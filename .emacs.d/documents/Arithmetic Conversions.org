K & R A.6.5 Arithmetic Conversions

* First, if either operand is long double, the other is converted to long double. 
* Otherwise, if either operand is double, the other is converted to double. 
* Otherwise, if either operand is float, the other is converted to float. 
* Otherwise, the integral promotions are performed on both operands; then, if either operand is unsigned long int, the other is converted to unsigned long int. 
* Otherwise, if one operand is long int and the other is unsigned int, the effect depends on whether a long int can represent all values of an unsigned int; if so, the unsigned int operand is converted to long int; if not, both are converted to unsigned long int. 
* Otherwise, if one operand is long int, the other is converted to long int. 
* Otherwise, if either operand is unsigned int, the other is converted to unsigned int. 
* Otherwise, both operands have type int.
